Code requires the csv files with the weather and supply data from germany saved into the "data" folder

Then follow those steps:
1. run split_csv_by_region.py
2. run transform_supply_csv.py
3. Then you can test all train files (naming them "train" was kind of misleading cause it does also test als calculate the crps values...)
